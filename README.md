# Dice-game-project

This is one of my first basic projects in Flutter using Dart programming language. This required knowledge in Object oriented Programming, Dart language, Flutter framework and Widget trees as well as custom built Data Structures. Feel free to run this code in Visual Studio code along with an Android simulator tool like Android Studio to see this app in live action!
